#summary Comparing Guice's error handling with Spring's.

= Introduction =

This is example code that randomly compares Guice error handling with Spring error handling. This uses the example shown [GuicySpring here].

Guice's error handling is one of the framework's great strengths.
  * Lots of mistakes get detected at compile time.
  * You will see all the mistakes you made in one go, not only the first one.
  * Guice links to the offending configuration code in the error message, on which you can click to navigate to the line of configuration that matters (Java IDE feature).
  * Guice's error messages actually help.
